Postfix is quite easy to configure, especially for relaying through a "smarthost" (Gmail or ISP or whatever).

Configuring Postfix for Gmail:

Update /etc/postfix/main.cf:

relayhost = [smtp.gmail.com]:587
smtp_tls_security_level = encrypt
smtp_tls_CApath = /etc/ssl/certs
smtp_sasl_auth_enable = yes
smtp_sasl_password_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
smtp_sasl_security_options = noanonymous
Create /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd:

[smtp.gmail.com]:587     joe@gmail.com:JoesSekritPassword
Run as root:

postmap /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
chmod 640 /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*
chgrp postfix /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd*
Tell Postfix to reload configuration:

postfix reload
Exim is not bad either, as long as you ignore all the Debian-specific tutorials and their macros nonsense.

There also are msmtp and esmtp, which can only use a smarthost and so don't need to be run as a daemon. They also are much easier to configure, especially for multi-user environments.

If you are looking for the mail command, make sure you get either heirloom-mailx or GNU mailutils. (The classic bsd-mailx works, but it lacks many features such as Maildir or MIME support.) I still prefer mutt, though.
